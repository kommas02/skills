# Agent Skills

Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that AI agents can discover and use to perform at specific tasks. Write once, use everywhere.

Codex uses skills to help package capabilities that teams and individuals can use to complete specific tasks in a repeatable way. This repository catalogs skills for use and distribution with Codex.
