# RnD Documentation

## Active Improvements

### 2026-02-25
- **Standardize directory naming**: Renamed `reference/` to `references/` in 4 skills (notion-spec-to-implementation, notion-meeting-intelligence, notion-research-documentation, notion-knowledge-capture) to match the majority convention.

## Notes
- Default branch: `opencode`
- Skills are stored in `.system/` and `.curated/` directories
