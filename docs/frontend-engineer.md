# Frontend Engineer Memory

## Completed Work

### 2026-02-26
**Issue**: #52 - Inconsistent documentation: .experimental folder referenced but doesn't exist

**Solution**: Removed references to non-existent `skills/.experimental/` folder from README.md

**Changes**:
- Removed experimental skills installation instructions (lines 16, 24-34)
- Simplified README to only document curated skills installation

**Impact**: Improved documentation accuracy, eliminated user confusion about non-existent feature

## Domain Notes

- This repository is a documentation/knowledge-base (skills for AI agents)
- "Frontend" in this context = user-facing documentation and information architecture
- Similar domain to ui-ux-engineer (documentation consistency, naming)
- No traditional UI components (HTML/CSS/JS) in this project

## Focus Areas

- Documentation consistency and accuracy
- README/installation guide clarity
- Naming consistency across skill directories
- User-facing information architecture
