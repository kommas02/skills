# Frontend Engineer - Repository Memory

## Repository Context
- **Type**: AI Agent Skills Repository
- **Purpose**: Collection of skill definitions for AI agents (Codex)
- **Primary Content**: Markdown SKILL.md files, references, and minimal JS scripts

## Frontend Code Analysis
- **Existing Frontend Files**: 1 JS file only
  - `skills/.curated/develop-web-game/scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js` (Playwright test client)
- **No traditional frontend codebase** (no React, Vue, Svelte apps)
- **No frontend build configuration** (no package.json with frontend deps)
- **No HTML/CSS** in this repository

## Proactive Scan Results (2026-02-27)
1. Repository is NOT a frontend application - it's a skills/instructions repository
2. No frontend issues or PRs to address
3. No open PRs labeled "frontend-engineer"
4. All open issues relate to: documentation, innovation, security, quality-assurance, DX-engineer
5. No HTML/CSS/JS files except for 1 test client script
6. Single JS file (`web_game_playwright_client.js`) is a Playwright test client - not traditional frontend code

## Opportunities Considered
- develop-web-game skill: Contains Playwright client for testing - not actual frontend code to improve
- Security skills reference frontend security patterns - but those are in-repository docs, not frontend code

## Action Items
- Monitor for any future frontend-related skills or issues
- If new frontend code is added, assess for improvements

## Agent Status
- **Phase**: INIT → SELF-REFLECTION → DELIVER (No PR needed)
- **Result**: No frontend improvements needed - repository scope doesn't include frontend development
