# UI/UX Engineer Memory

## Completed Work

### 2026-02-25
**Issue**: Standardize directory naming: reference/ vs references/ inconsistency

**Solution**: Renamed `reference` (singular) to `references` (plural) in 4 skills to match the 19 other skills using consistent naming.

**Skills updated**:
- notion-knowledge-capture
- notion-meeting-intelligence
- notion-research-documentation
- notion-spec-to-implementation

**Impact**: Improved information architecture consistency across skill directories, making navigation predictable for users.

## Domain Notes
- This repository is primarily documentation/knowledge-base focused
- UI/UX improvements focus on: information architecture, naming consistency, navigation clarity
- No traditional UI components (HTML/CSS/JS) in this project
