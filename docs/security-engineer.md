# Security Engineer Memory

## Completed Work

### 2026-02-26
**Init**: Security-engineer agent initialized

**Proactive Scan Results**:
- Verified 3 curated security skills exist:
  - `security-best-practices` - Language/framework-specific security guidance
  - `security-ownership-map` - Security ownership topology and bus factor analysis  
  - `security-threat-model` - Repository-grounded threat modeling
- Verified no sensitive data or secrets in repository
- Verified `.gitignore` is appropriate
- Verified GitHub workflows are properly configured

**Status**: Repository security posture is healthy for a skills/documentation repository.

## Domain Notes
- This repository is a Codex/OpenCode skills library
- Security skills provide guidance to AI agents, not runtime security
- Skills are triggered explicitly by users for security tasks
- No traditional application security concerns (no auth, database, etc.)
