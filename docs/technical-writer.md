Domain: Documentation, templates, and content standards.

## Completed Work

### Issue #37: Create skill template with required sections standardization
- Created `docs/skill-template.md`
- Defines REQUIRED sections: frontmatter, When to use, Workflow
- Defines RECOMMENDED sections: Prerequisites, Dependencies, Environment, Temp/output conventions
- Defines OPTIONAL sections: Examples, Quality expectations, Troubleshooting, References
- Includes directory structure and checklist

## Patterns Observed

- Skills follow consistent directory structure: SKILL.md, LICENSE.txt, references/, scripts/, agents/, assets/, evaluations/
- SKILL.md frontmatter: name + description (required)
- Common sections: When to use, Workflow, Dependencies, Environment
- Quality expectations and troubleshooting are common in mature skills

## Future Improvements

- Audit existing skills against template
- Add more examples to the template based on skill diversity
